# quic-traffic #

This repository contains traffic examples for the quic-go package.
This avoids commits unrelated to the development of QUIC itself.

Notice that if logging is required, this can be done through environment variable QUIC_GO_LOG_LEVEL=loglevel set, with loglevel "DEBUG", "INFO" or "ERROR".
See https://github.com/lucas-clemente/quic-go/wiki/Logging for more details.
